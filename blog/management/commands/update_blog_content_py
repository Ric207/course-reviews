Unlike the old HELB system where everyone got a standard loan, this new system classifies families into four specific 'Bands' based on monthly household income. If you get classified wrongly, you could end up paying Ksh 200,000+ per year instead of Ksh 10,000.

            [LOCKED CONTENT STARTS HERE]

            **The Classification Bands (The Secret Criteria):**
            * **Band 1 (Vulnerable):** Families earning less than **Ksh 5,995**.
                * *Benefit:* 100% Government Scholarship + Upkeep Loan of Ksh 60,000. You pay **Zero Fees**.
            * **Band 2 (Extremely Needy):** Income between **Ksh 5,995 and Ksh 23,670**.
                * *Benefit:* 70% Scholarship, 30% Loan. You pay approx **7% of fees**.
            * **Band 3 (Needy):** Income between **Ksh 23,671 and Ksh 70,000**.
                * *Benefit:* 50% Scholarship, 30% Loan. You pay **20% of fees**.
            * **Band 4 & 5 (Less Needy):** Income **above Ksh 70,000**.
                * *Risk:* You pay **40% to 60% of fees**.

            **How to Win an Appeal:**
            If you are placed in Band 4 or 5 but cannot afford it, you must appeal. The system checks for 'markers of poverty'.
            * **Tip 1:** Upload a death certificate if a parent is deceased.
            * **Tip 2:** Upload siblings' birth certificates to prove high dependency ratio.
            * **Tip 3:** Do NOT use a photo of a permanent stone house during application; this triggers the 'Less Needy' flag automatically.""",

            "From Diploma to Degree It Is Possible": """Missing the C+ cutoff in KCSE often feels like the end of the road, but for many successful Kenyans, it was just a detour. The 'TVET Pathway' is actually a hidden gem. Employers in 2025 often prefer Diploma graduates because they have 3 years of practical, hands-on experience compared to Degree students who focus on theory.

            **The 'Credit Transfer' Hack:**
            You do not have to start from Year 1.
            * **Step 1:** Enroll in a KNEC Diploma course (2-3 years) at a Technical Training Institute (TTI) or Polytechnic. Cost is low (approx Ksh 30k/year with capitation).
            * **Step 2:** Score a **Credit** or **Distinction**.
            * **Step 3:** Apply for a 'Credit Transfer' at a university like TUK, MKU, or Strathmore. They can exempt you from up to **40% of the degree units**, allowing you to join in **Year 2 or Year 3**.

            **Best Courses for this Path:**
            * **Pharmaceutical Technology:** High demand, easy transition to B.Pharm.
            * **Quantity Surveying:** Diploma holders often start their own construction firms immediately.
            * **Software Engineering:** Skills matter more than papers. A portfolio built during your diploma is worth more than a degree.""",

            "University of Nairobi vs JKUAT Which is Better": """This is the ultimate rivalry in Kenyan higher education: The prestigious City Campus (UoN) vs. The Tech Farm in Juja (JKUAT). Your choice shouldn't just be about the name, but about the *culture* and *resources* specific to your field. Choosing the wrong one can mean 4 years of frustration.

            [LOCKED CONTENT STARTS HERE]

            **1. Engineering & Technology:**
            * **Winner: JKUAT.**
            * *Why:* JKUAT was built for tech. Their labs in Juja are better equipped for practicals (Mechatronics, Civil, Agricultural Engineering). UoN is theory-heavy.
            
            **2. Medicine & Health:**
            * **Winner: UoN.**
            * *Why:* UoN medical school is physically attached to Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH). You get exposure to complex referral cases that JKUAT students in smaller hospitals don't see.

            **3. The 'Strike' Factor:**
            * **Winner: JKUAT.** Historically, JKUAT has a more stable academic calendar. UoN politics can lead to strikes that delay graduation by up to a year.

            **4. Campus Life:**
            * **UoN:** Fast-paced, hustler mentality, expensive city living.
            * **JKUAT:** Community vibe, cheaper rent in Juja, focused environment.""",

                * *The Secret:* Don't work for Kenyan firms. Learn Python/React and work remotely for US/European startups (Andela, Microsoft ADC).

                * *Salary:* **Ksh 300,000 - Ksh 1M+**
                * *The Catch:* It takes 12+ years of study to reach this level. Interns only earn ~Ksh 150k.

                * *Salary:* **Ksh 180,000 - Ksh 350,000**
                * *Why:* Banks (Equity, KCB) and Telcos (Safaricom) are desperate for people who can analyze big data.

                * *Salary:* **Ksh 200,000+**
                * *Requirement:* You MUST pass the professional papers (SOA/IFoA). A degree alone pays peanuts (Ksh 40k).
            5.  **NGO Project Management (UN/World Bank):**
                * *Salary:* **Ksh 200,000 - Ksh 500,000 (Tax-Free)**

            * **Choice 1b (The Smart Swap):** Same course, different uni (e.g., Medicine at Maseno). The cutoff is usually 1-2 points lower.
            * **Choice 2 (The Pivot):** A related professional course (e.g., Pharmacy or Dental Surgery).
            * **Choice 3 (The Safety Net):** A course where your Cluster Points are **5+ points higher** than the cutoff (e.g., Nursing).
            * **Choice 4 (The Guarantee):** A course you are overqualified for, just to ensure you get a government capitation slot.

            1.  **The 'Math' Test:**
                * Did you score B+ or higher in Math? Go for **Engineering, CS, Actuarial, or Statistics**.
                * Did you struggle in Math? Avoid these at all costs. You will drop out in Year 2. Look at **Law, Media, or IR**.

            2.  **The 'Introvert vs Extrovert' Test:**
                * *Introvert:* Can you sit at a computer for 10 hours? **Computer Science / Accounting**.
                * *Extrovert:* Do you need to talk to people? **Marketing / HR / Medicine / Law**.

            3.  **The 'Saturation' Check:**
                * *Saturated:* Procurement, General Business Management, General B.Com. (Too many graduates).
